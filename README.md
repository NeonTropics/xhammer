# xhammer
Ripping xHamster with yt-dlp_linux (maybe Windows too?) has been broken for a while now. This is quick and dirty (pun intended) wrapper to allow ripping videos from the site.


# Requirements

Download a build of yt-dlp_linux from https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp.

# Usage

Put the scripts and the yt-dlp binary in a folder and invoke with ./xhammer.sh. You will prompted for a xHamster URL, the script will do the rest!
